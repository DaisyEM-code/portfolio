# About Me:
---
As an aspiring data analyst, I bring a unique perspective shaped by my background in chemistry. After earning my degree in Chemistry, I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, which I believe are essential skills in the data analytics field.
During my time as a Scientist, I honed my abilities in data collection, interpretation, and reporting. I regularly analyzed complex numerical data from experiments, utilizing statistical methods to identify trends and make informed decisions. My experience with laboratory instrumentation and software tools has equipped me with a solid understanding of data management and the importance of accuracy in reporting.
My passion for turning data into actionable insights led me to explore the world of data analysis. I have since pursued additional training in data analysis tools such as Python and SQL, enhancing my ability to manipulate and visualize data effectively.
I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my scientific background and analytical experience to contribute to data-driven decision-making. My goal is to bridge the gap between chemistry and data analytics, applying my skills to solve real-world problems and drive innovation in various industries.
I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and continuing to grow as a data analyst.
